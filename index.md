Hello! I am an adjunct instructor at the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.olemiss.edu/) of the [University of Mississippi](https://olemiss.edu/). 
I will be a postdoctoral fellow at Paris Observatory of PSL University, Paris in the fall of 2023. I did my Ph.D. in physics under the supervision of [Leo Stein](https://duetosymmetry.com/).



My CV can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/sashwat_tanay_cv.pdf).
Its LaTeX template is available on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/sashwattanay/Curriculum-Vitae).

My research areas include

(i) studying binary black holes and their gravitational waves in the post-Newtonian approximation

(ii) quasi-normal modes of black holes.
