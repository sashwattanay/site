Two of the problems I worked on during my Ph.D. with 
[Leo Stein](https://duetosymmetry.com/) led to


1. discovery of two new constants of motion for the 2nd 
post-Newtonian (PN) binary black hole (BBH) systems.
[This](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06586) is the paper.


2. action-angle (AA) based closed-form solutins to the 
orbital dynamics of the 1.5PN BBH system. The relevant
papers are [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06586),
[this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15351), and
[this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01605).



For a set of lectures delivered to 
[Prof. Nicolas Yunes'] group at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign, I prepared 
[these](https://github.com/sashwattanay/lectures_integrability_action-angles_PN_BBH/blob/gh-action-result/pdflatex/lecture_notes/main.pdf)
set of lecture notes. To cite these, please use the 
[arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05799).
NOTE: these notes do not represent the material of my above 
papers on AA-based solutuion. They instead are meant to bring a
beginning graduate student up to speed so that they can read these
papers. These lecture notes assume the familiarity with the standard
graduate level physics courses on the reader's part.



As a by-product, 
[here]({{ site.url }}/assets/2023/2023-04-13-Poisson_bracket_notebook.nb)
is a Mathematica notebook (authored by 
[Leo Stein](https://duetosymmetry.com/)), which lets you compute the Poisson brackets (PBs)
between any two functions of the phase-space variables
 (position, momenta, and spins). The fundamental  PB relations that this notebook
 assumes are Eqs. (6) of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06586).
 You must have [xAct](http://www.xact.es/)
 installed on your computer for this notebook to work.
