In Feb 2023, I gave a public outreach talk on why does
the Moon not crash into the earth. It's inpired from an
[earlier video](https://youtu.be/K8ms_4SJh9Q) of mine.
This video argues that the Moon and a falling object
are essentially very similar; it's just that the Moon
has been "thrown" with a much larger speed. Check it out.



If you want to run the simulations, and have a Mathematica subscription,
 you can download 
[this]({{ site.url }}/assets/2023/2023-04-13-satellite_simulation.nb)
more refined Mathematica notebook.



If you don't have a Mathematica subscription, you can still run the
simulation.
On [this page]({{ site.url }}/2023/04/13/wolfram_cloud), I show how to run 
Wolfram Mathematica codes for free on 
[Wolfram Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com/). Once you have watched this video,
you will need 
[this]({{ site.url }}/assets/2023/2023-04-13-satellite_simulation.m)
.m file to run the simulations.




These simulations can be used by science undergraduates, and 
also school teachers as teaching aids.
