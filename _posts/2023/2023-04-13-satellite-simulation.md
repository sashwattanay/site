In Feb 2023, I gave a public outreach talk on why does
the Moon not crash into the earth. It's inpired from an
[earlier video](https://youtu.be/K8ms_4SJh9Q) of mine.
This video argues that the Moon and a falling object
are essentially very similar; it's just that the Moon
has been "thrown" with a much larger speed.
