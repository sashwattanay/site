1. Many of my Ph.D. years were devoted to studying post-Newtonian
binary black hole systems from the point of view of integrability and
action-angle variables. I have compiled some resources 
[here]({{ site.url }}/2023/04/13/pn-aa-variables).


2. The LaTeX template for my CV can be found 
[here](https://github.com/sashwattanay/Curriculum-Vitae), whereas the one
for writing lengthy documents (with various chapters and correspondingly
separate source files) can be found 
[here](https://github.com/sashwattanay/Thesis-Report-LaTeX-Template).
These can be used to write theses, reports or lecture notes.



3. On [this page]({{ site.url }}/2023/04/13/wolfram_cloud), I show how to run 
Wolfram Mathematica codes for free on 
[Wolfram Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com/).
