1. This website is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
 and is hosted for free
on GitHub. It was made using the
[Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) Jekyll theme by David Darnes.
The source code is on 
[this](https://github.com/sashwattanay/site) GitHub repo.


2. Many of my Ph.D. years were devoted to studying post-Newtonian
binary black hole systems from the point of view of integrability and
action-angle variables. I have compiled some resources 
[here]({{ site.url }}/2023/04/13/pn-aa-variables).


3. The LaTeX template for my CV can be found 
[here](https://github.com/sashwattanay/Curriculum-Vitae), whereas the one
for writing lengthy documents (with various chapters and correspondingly
separate source files) can be found 
[here](https://github.com/sashwattanay/Thesis-Report-LaTeX-Template).
These can be used to write theses, reports or lecture notes.



4. On [this page]({{ site.url }}/2023/04/13/wolfram_cloud), I show how to run 
Wolfram Mathematica codes for free on 
[Wolfram Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com/).
My other tech-related tutorial videos can be found
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SToy_OXS45U&list=PL-UKo7OfOXE_iWHE6m-Kbm0kmiJdJJlYz&ab_channel=SashwatTanay).
