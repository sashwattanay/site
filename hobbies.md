[Here](https://youtu.be/nf7o6I_BETE) is a 
soothing piano instrumental of Elvis Presley's
"Falling in love with you" that I recorded.

I am trying to learn to play piano. 
[Here](https://youtu.be/tRbLFhNZF9c) I am playing on 
piano a [song](https://youtu.be/VXtDiSeqDqY) sung by my cousin.


I recorded myself singing a [Mandarin song](https://youtu.be/bv_cEeDlop0)
 by the Taiwanese singer [Teresa Teng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Teng).
[Here](https://youtu.be/86DAWrvN1t4) is the recording; please use headphones.



Additionally, I like to make YouTube videos on tech-related tutorials.
