I did my Ph.D. in physics under the supervision of [Leo Stein](https://duetosymmetry.com/).
My CV can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/sashwat_tanay_cv.pdf).
Its LaTeX template is available on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/sashwattanay/Curriculum-Vitae).




My research areas include

(i) studying binary black holes and their gravitational waves in the post-Newtonian approximation

(ii) quasi-normal modes of black holes.


My research articles can be found at 
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EiZB2pgAAAAJ&hl=en),
 [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/gr-qc?searchtype=author&query=Tanay%2C+S), and
 [inspire HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1947311). 


Many of my Ph.D. years were devoted to studying post-Newtonian
binary black hole systems from the point of view of integrability and
action-angle variables. I have compiled some resources 
[here]({{ site.url }}/2023/04/13/pn-aa-variables).
